# MABA6490-Spotify
 
This Spotify app runs on streamlit and builds a custom playlist based on your current mood. The music database was pulled from Kaggle and contains the top ~1500 songs at the time of app creation. The playlist is generated using a KNN algorithm. It also loads a clustered dataset and predicts which cluster most closely aligns with the user inputs.
